# IP-Packet Parser
------
One of my first projects I worked on. 
It was interesting project because I learned a lot about how packets worked. 
It opened me up to a lot of different networking ideas and concepts that I now have an over-arching high-level knowledge of the concepts in netowrking.
This was the turning point to where I also started to prefer C/C++ in industry and appreciated all it taught me.

## Compile
------
This is simply compiled with GCC on each file.

### IPV4
By far the easiest and has an interesting packet structure. 
It was very fun to make and taught me a lot about bits and bit manipulation especially used in signal processing at the software level.

### IPV6
A harder attempt since IPv6 can collapse but it was still a fun and education time.
